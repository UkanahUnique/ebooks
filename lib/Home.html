            <h2 style="color: slateblue;">The Abridged History of the Institution</h2><span>The Federal Polytechnic Bida began in 1977 following the 
              decision of the Federal Government of Nigeria to move to Bida the then Federal College of Technology, Kano. In the same year the first 
              Principal Professor J. W. Brooks, a Canadian, was appointed on the 5th of September 1977. The Bida College of Technology as it was called 
              then embarked on the task of recruiting pioneer staff. The first academic session started April 1978 with 211 students and a staff strength 
              of 11 senior staff and 33 junior staff. With the promulgation of Federal Polytechnic Decree number 33 of 1979, the Bida College of Technology
               automatically became The Federal Polytechnic Bida.<br>
               The permanent site of The Federal Polytechnic lies along Bida Doko Road and covers a land area of about 400 hectares that is approximately 2km
                by 2km. Physical development of the site started in early 1979 and by October that same year, the administrative staff and some departments
                 had moved to the permanent site. The development continued in phases and the polytechnic is housed comfortably in its permanent site today.

                 reading plays adverse roles in their life. Being a student one should explore different paths which help them to grow.</span>

          <h4> Every day humans go about looking for things, either in their respective houses, or in their offices. It will be highly beneficial if what
             one is looking for can easily be found. This gave birth to an arrangement of things just to save time of searching. The fields of library
              and information science, informatics, computer science, and others are all concerned with the specific types of resources and collections
               that constitute their respective professions. This concentration produces disciplinary and domain-specific terminology, making it
                difficult to apply concepts, methodologies, and insights across disciplines. The fundamental concept of organization, on the other hand,
                 that is it can swallow and synthesize the various perspectives and conceptions about organization from its feeder disciplines can be 
                 subsumed and synthesized under a more abstract framework. This system balances the focus on specific resource and collection types with
                  a framework that views organizing systems as current in a multi-dimensional design cosmos in which we can take a look at a variation of
                   sites at the same time and watch how they interact.
                   <br>Technology has progressed to the point where the manual way of bookkeeping is now merged into an electronic system commonly referred to
            as an E-book. Most times people find it very difficult to get a particular book because they don’t know the title of the book. With this
             system, if one could know either the year the book was published, or the title of the book or the author’s name, one can easily
              get the particular book one is searching for. </h4>
